## General Info

I built this railing for our new home after pricing similar commercial options.

The construction is fairly simple, just vertical posts every 4 inches following the necessary angles. Grinding and painting all of this was a bit of a chore but otherwise, it went fairly well.

Be sure to double-check real-world dimensions when doing a project like this, before and after the trim goes on.
